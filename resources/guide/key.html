    <b>About the
        questionnaires</b>
    <p>This 2022 voter guide includes responses to surveys conducted by Baltimore Sun Media. We asked candidates to tell
        us about themselves, list their qualifications for office and respond to policy questions. Their answers are in
        their own words. </p>

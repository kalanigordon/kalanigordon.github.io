<p>I grew up a singer, dancer, soccer player and storyteller. I hated being front and center on the stage, and I was never the star player (though I'll argue with you I was a critical one from a strategic standpoint) and never shared my stories or poetry.</p>
<p>Then I decided I wanted to be a journalist.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Utah, ditched the Beehive State for a stint in the Pacific Northwest. Now, I'm a 2016 graduate of the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. When I was there, I worked at the <a class="red spaced" href="https://www.dailyemerald.com/" target="_blank">Daily Emerald</a> and <a class="red spaced" href="https://www.klcc.org/" target="_blank">KLCC</a>. I interned at <a class="red spaced" href="https://kslnewsradio.com/" target="_blank">KSL Newsradio</a> and came back in 2016 after wrapping up my time in Oregon. </p>
<p>I was introduced to the <a class="red spaced" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jeff-caplans-afternoon-news/id73799934" target="_blank">Jeff Caplan's Afternoon News</a> team in the summer of 2018, and became its executive producer later that fall.</p>

<p>As the <b>executive producer for the afternoon news at KSL Newsradio</b>, I manage anchors, hosts, breaking news, reporters, board operators, people who call the station, traffic reporters, digital producers, other radio producers, interns ... and there's probably someone I'm forgetting — but you get my point.</p>
<p>I'm pulled in a hundred different directions every minute. I make the tough decisions in milliseconds. I break news the second I know it. I manage a team that's not even all in the building, let alone the same room, with interns in the mix.</p>
<p>I'm the youngest executive producer at my company. My spirit, drive and work have earned me the reputation of "pint-sized firecracker" among my peers.</p>

<p>If you know me, you know I've got a cup of coffee, a good book, my camera and a notebook in hand. I enjoy being outside, exploring the state I grew up in and adventuring to new places I've never been before.

<p class="caption">I often joke that my job is all about the "other duties as assigned" part of the job description. This was one of those "other duties" — AKA show your host how to do a burpee. </p>
